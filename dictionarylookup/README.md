### Memo

I have been wanting to try writing some easy GUI stuff for quite some time. Then I stumbled upon this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/D8-snVfekto) walking through the process of creating an easy weather app using `tkinter`. So I thought I would just follow through, but probably do something a bit different so as to keep it more interesting.

Then I realized that another thing I want to try out is something that can fetch definitions of words from a website. Actually I bought an Oxford Dictionary app on my phone. But, really, when working on a computer, sometimes moving hands away from the keyboard, getting the phone, opening the app, and then finally typing in the word are just too many steps. I end up looking words up online a lot.

But this online dictionary website does not provide API for querying words. So my plan is just to examine the page source and then search for the desired content. Well, I guess maybe there are better ways to do this, but never mind that. Maybe keep it for another time.

Here are resources I find useful for getting a web content using python: https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/scrape/, https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp
