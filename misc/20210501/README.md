### Notes

I recently saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqpIcsN0FTI) on Youtube and thought it was cool so I looked into the [corresponding git repo](https://github.com/johnBuffer/NoCol) and tried to learn how it was done.

I tried to do some really simple stuff here myself to get the feel of it.
